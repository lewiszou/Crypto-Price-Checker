            <button class="collapsible">1.0 What is Ethereum?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to Wikipedia, “Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computer platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality”. In simpler terms, Ethereum wants to become a “world computer” that would decentralize the internet, turning servers and clouds into “nodes”, which are run by volunteer computers. For example, consider the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. Currently, when you download or purchase an app, that transaction is governed by Google or Apple, a third party. However, Ethereum removes the third party governance, so that if you wanted to download or purchase an app, you would complete the transaction directly with the author, removing risk of a third-party entity that could change or remove your product at any time.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">1.1 ​Who created Ethereum?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum and Bitcoin Magazine.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">1.2 How does Ethereum work?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Ethereum is a platform, with Ether as the token that fuels the network. Ethereum uses Smart Contracts, which is computer code that facilitates the exchange or anything of value. Developers can create any operation on the network, allowing the process of creating a blockchain application easier than ever. Instead of building an entirely original blockchain for each new application, Ethereum allows development of any number of applications all on their platform. For example, many new cryptocurrency ICOs are now created on the Ethereum platform, due to the ease of creating new blockchains.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">1.3 How does one get Ethereum?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum can be mined with GPU. However, just like with Bitcoin, the difficulty in mining Ethereum has been greatly increased. Without advanced computer systems specialized for mining cryptocurrency, mining Ethereum would be extremely slow and difficult. Now that Ethereum has become more popular, there are other ways like faucets or giveaways to earn small amounts of Ethereum.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">2.0 How does one make a Ethereum payment?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>All that’s needed to complete a Ethereum payment is a wallet with Ethereum. Similarly to paying with cash (in this example, I’ll use US Dollars), you would simply send your USD (Ethereum) from your wallet to another person’s address (I’ll discuss wallets further below). Receiving Ethereum is similar, just like how someone else would give you cash for you to put in your wallet, someone else will send Bitcoins from their wallet to your wallet’s public address. The fee for the transaction is called gas, and is mathematically determined by the miners.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">2.1 Advantages to accumulating Ethereum?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The greatest value of cryptocurrency like Ethereum is its platform decentralization and its ease in creating new blockchains. Because most applications are created from the ground up, having a platform for easy blockchain creation will continue to be valuable, driving the value of the coin. Furthermore, the decentralization of the platform is similar to the decentralization of Bitcoin, removing the risk of having a third-party entity at the helm of an application. With more and more cryptocurrencies and companies resorting to blockchain technology, Ethereum’s value will only continue to evolve and appreciate.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">2.2 Disadvantages to investing in Ethereum?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The disadvantages of investing in Ethereum remains limited. However, like with all cryptocurrencies, the market is still extremely volatile. In general, due to Ethereum’s value as a decentralized blockchain platform, it will continue to retain great value.</p>

                <p>Online Exchanges: Easiest for exchanging
                    Coinbase: Coinbase remains one of the largest Ethereum exchanges in the world, a platform where users are able to buy and sell Ethereum, as well as exchange Ethereum for other coins, like Bitcoin and Litecoin. However, the risks of storing large amounts of Ethereum on Online Exchanges is the greatest, with possibilities of getting hacked.
                    Other Online Exchanges: Bittrex, Binance (These two support more coins than Coinbase).</p>

            <button class="collapsible">3.1 What happens if you lose Ethereum?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The only way to lose Ethereum is to forget your password to your virtual wallet or to get your account shut down/hacked. If you lose Ethereum in these ways, there is unfortunately no way to recover it. Most of the times the Ethereum that is lost remains lost and that amount is taken away from the world pot of Ethereum. However, because there is a limit on the amount of Ethereum to be produced, the price of each Ethereum will rise.</p>
