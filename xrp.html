                <div class="content">
                    <p>According to Ripple.com’s whitepaper, RippleNet delivers a single, frictionless experience .” In simpler terms, Ripple’s network removes the need for unstandardized and centralized banking systems with its single, global group of banks that provide real-time messaging and completion of transactions. Ripple strives to provide better connectivity across payment networks, faster transaction speeds, real-time tracking of payments, and low operation costs. In essence, Ripple wants to update the payment infrastructure.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">1.1 ​Who created XRP?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Ripple was created by Ripple Labs, with Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen as co-founders of the company.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">1.2 How does XRP work?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>RippleNet is a system that gathers current standing banks to join their network, in order to systemize payments and transactions. Ripple brings in banks like Bank of America, Royal Bank of Canada, and Bank of Mitsubishi to allow cross-border payments through its advanced blockchain technology. Once the banks have been linked on RippleNet, Ripple Labs hopes to bring in actual citizens and individuals to adopt Ripple as the currency for worldwide currency exchanges.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">1.3 How does one get XRP?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Ripple cannot be mined; the 100 Billion XRP has already been minted by Ripple Labs can only be acquired through purchase through an exchange. Now that Ripple has been more spread, there are other ways like faucets or giveaways to earn small amounts of Ripple.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">2.0 How does one make a XRP payment?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Similarly to paying with cash (in this example, I’ll use US Dollars), you would simply send your Ripple from your wallet to another person’s address (I’ll discuss wallets further below). Receiving Bitcoins is similar, just like how someone else would give you cash for you to put in your wallet, someone else will send Bitcoins from their wallet to your wallet’s public address. Unlike Bitcoin however, Ripple can only be sent through whole amounts, while Bitcoin’s can be sent in decimals (one satoshi is .00000001).</p>

                <button class="collapsible">2.1 Advantages to accumulating XRP?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The greatest value of cryptocurrency like Ripple is its ability to combine the world’s banks into one currency communication network. Because most currencies are dependent on a countries economy, currencies can quickly lose value due to a countries political unrest, and require conversion between those value differences. Ripple however, allows the ability for one currency for banks across the world, allowing quicker and cheaper transactions.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">2.2 Disadvantages to investing in XRP?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Since Ripple is still new, volatility occurs in its markets. Ripple hasn’t been actually tested on the real market. It hasn’t been as heavily used as Bitcoin. Furthermore, if banks don’t join RippleNet, the value of Ripple will greatly depreciate. The success of Ripple, more so than most currencies, greatly depends on adoption by banks, and then by the global population.</p>

                    <p>Online Exchanges: Easiest for exchanging
                        Bittrex and Binance provide the ability to store and exchange Ripple for USD and other coins, and while not as safe from hacks as a Hardware Wallet may be, has easy access for transactions and purchases.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">3.1 What happens if you lose XRP?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The way to lose Ripple is to forget your password to your virtual wallet or to get your account shut down/hacked. If you lose Ripple in these ways, there is unfortunately no way to recover it. Most of the times the Ripple that is lost remains lost and that amount is taken away from the world pot of Ripple. However, because there is a limit on the amount of Ripple to be produced, the value of each remaining Ripple will rise.</p>
